# Participate!

An app for democratic decision-making.

Participate! aims to improve citizen participation in public issues, and participation in general at any organization interested in shared, democratic management.

It does so by focusing on concrete proposals rather than noisy and many times unproductive debate. 

A participant makes a proposal and gathers support for it. Other participants can collaborate on it if they support it in principle. Dissenters have to make a counter-proposal, and gather support for it as well, to be heard. 

Representation is ensured for participants who are less involved (be it for lack of time, inclination or of knowledge) through fluid delegation of support, in a [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy).

Early stages of development. Participate! is open source and plans are to have a hosted version in the future as well.
